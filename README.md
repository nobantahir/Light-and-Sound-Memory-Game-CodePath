Submitted by: **MUHAMMAD NOBAN TAHIR**

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
All work was done on my own and using the provided prework website here https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/summer_internship_for_tech_excellence/prework. I used one website to get color codes that I used to edit the font and background colors, https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I have a very basic understanding of the programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That being said, I focused on refreshing what I know by taking the time to read the extra provided resources and look through 
those to get a good feel and understanding of HTML and CSS.
Towards the end of the program, there was a portion for handling the guesses and developing game logic. I had an understanding of the logic, but was stumped initially when trying to write the code on my own. 
I overcame this by drawing out the buttons and the logic diagram (that was provided) to physically see 
the connections of the code and what needed to be handled so that the guesses could be checked to determine if the game needs to end due to losing, continue, or end due to winning. 
This helped clear my mind and I was able to get a better idea and see what I was trying to accomplish piece by pice. 
I included what I wrote down on paper as comments in my code and worked from there do develop the code needed to do to process the guesses. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I like how far I got with using only basic web development, but I'm curious what it takes to get a fully fledged website up and running. Is HTML and CSS used to make dropdown buttons? Do they use images for buttons or is it formatted text? How do developers
make sure that their websites function across various broswers and screen sizes and still develop an optimized experience? I wonder what kind of challenges that developers face to ensure that websites are secure for users. I'm also curious as to how data is 
handled and how websites are hosted. There are so many different aspects of web development and I'm curious about production cycles and maintenance. I'd love to learn more about web development as a whole. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on the project, I'd like to make it more polished. Some things I would like to implement with that time are, random patterns, lives, and timers. This helps add some "rules" to the game and add some variety as well as tension by having a timer and lives.
I believe these features would have a positive impact on playter retention and game replay. A big thing I would like to do is make the game more visually appealing. This could be by having images pop up for "game over, you lost" and "victory" for winning. There is so much potential for this project
that I can't stop thinking of ideas! Another really nice feature could be a victory tracker that displays on the top right corner and shows the count for how many times you've won the game. I think adding shapes to the buttons such as a square, triangle, diamond, and circle would help the player
have a different way to memorize the order of the buttons. These would all polish the project and take it to another level.
